Installation
============

Requires >= Zend Framework 1.11

NOTE: These instructions assume a project created using `zf create project ...`

1. Create the following directories relative to the project root folder:
   - application\resources
   - doctrine
   - doctrine\fixtures
   - doctrine\migrations
   - doctrine\schema
   - doctrine\sql
   - providers

2. Move the files to the appropriate locations:
   - application/configs/doctrine.yaml
   - application/resources/Doctrine.php
   - providers/DoctrineProvider.php

3. Add the following lines to the '[production]' section of 'application.ini':

   pluginPaths[Application_Resource] = APPLICATION_PATH "/resources"
   config[] = APPLICATION_PATH "/configs/doctrine.yaml"

4. Do a sanity check and make sure your application still loads in a browser.


Run `zf ? doctrine` to get a list of zf tool commands.
